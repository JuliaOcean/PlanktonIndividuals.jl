# PlanktonIndividuals.jl

`PlanktonIndividuals.jl` simulates the behavior of plankton individual communities. The physiology of individual plankton cells (incl. Biosynthesis, Respiration, and Excretion) is parameterized as a function of ambient conditions (light, nutrients). The formulation is documented in [Phytoplankton Physiology](@ref).
